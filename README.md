## Quick start
### Usage 

```
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("xuan-liu/FGBench") # Loading all 

dataset_test = load_dataset("xuan-liu/FGBench", split = "test") # Benchmark dataset

dataset_train = load_dataset("xuan-liu/FGBench", split = "train")
```

# Explanation of each column

We provide basic Q&A in FGBench for general usage. To build your own Q&A with FGBench data please refer to the below detailed explanation of each columns. 

`question`: question used in FGBench about how functional group affect the property change.

`answer`: the ground truth answer for the question

`target_smiles`: SMILES of traget molecule, canonicalized by RDKit.

`target_mapped_smiles`: SMILES of the traget molecule with atom number, generated by RDKit. (SMILES will affect the order of atom number)

`ref_smiles`: SMILES of reference molecule, canonicalized by RDKit.

`ref_mapped_smiles`: SMILES of the reference molecule with atom number, generated by RDKit.

`target_diff`: Unique functional groups and alkanes in the target moleucle with a formate: `[FG_list, alkane_list]`, `FG_list`: `[[FG_name, number, list_of_atom_list], ...]`. An example of `target_diff` is `[[['Alkene', 1, [[1, 3]]]], [['C1 alkane', 2, [[0], [2]]]]]`

`ref_diff`: Unique functional groups and alkanes in the reference moleucle with a formate: `[FG_list, alkane_list]`, `FG_list`: `[[FG_name, number, list_of_atom_list], ...]`.

`disconnect_list`: Any group or alkane that will leave the target molecule. An example of `target_diff` is `[['Ether', [[1]]], ['C1 alkane', [[0]]]]`

`connect_dict`: A dictionary of groups with its connecting site.`{'C2 alkane ([CH2:7][CH3:8])': [[7, 6, 'target molecule']]}`

`target_label`: Ground truth label of target molecule on the `property_name`

`ref_label`: Ground truth label of reference molecule on the `property_name`

`property_name`: The property name 

`type`: The Q&A type of this question

`dataset`: The dataset name

`task_num`: The task/column number of the dataset 

`split`: Train/Test split label
